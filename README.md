## ABOUT
The first project in 42, libft, involves learning how the standard functions of C programming work by writing them from scratch and building a personal library. This project is vital as the library will be used for future assignments in 42.

If you are a 42 student, it is highly recommended that you go through the process of writing and testing your code yourself, rather than copying and pasting code that you only partially understand. If you have completed your piscine, there is no reason why you should not tackle this project on your own! Be patient and meticulous.
